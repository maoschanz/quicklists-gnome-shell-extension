# Quicklist (GNOME Shell extension)

A [GNOME Shell extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/about/) which adds dynamic quicklists to app icons' menu:

- file manager bookmarks (for Nautilus or Nemo) ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/dpXxtOS.jpg))
- recent files openable by the application ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/UPSssDJ.jpg))

**Warning:** this is not compatible with *Dash-To-Dock* or *Ubuntu-Dock* thumbnail previews. (It works with *Dash to panel*.)

Available in Dutch, French, Polish and English.

## Recommenced installation

Search "Quicklists" in GNOME Software, or install it from [this website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1747/quicklists/).

## Manual installation

- Download files
- Run `./install`. It will move the "`quicklists@maestroschan.fr`" folder into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`.
- You may need to restart the gnome shell environment ("logout and login again", or alt + f2 + `r` + enter).
- Then activate it (with GNOME Tweaks, or from GNOME Software, or directly launch `gnome-shell-extension-prefs`).
